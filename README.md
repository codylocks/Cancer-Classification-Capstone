# Classifying Brain Tumors using a Convolutional Neural Net.

## Problem Statement:

Can we classify different types of brain cancers from whole slide images?

## Executive Summary:

### Data Collection: 

Data was taken from [GDC Cancer Portal](https://gdc.cancer.gov/). 

I used the 1703 primary diagnostic slides from the brain cancer sections. And downloaded:

1. Manifest (text file)
1. Clinical data (json)
1. Metadata (json)
